# Review — human-resolvable blockers

This file tracks **only** items that an engineer cannot resolve independently. Every entry
requires external input: an approval, a credential, an account, an access grant, or a decision
that belongs to a named owner outside the engineering task itself.

Anything an engineer can solve without external input belongs in [`TODO.md`](TODO.md), not here.
Application-level blockers live in the core repository's `REVIEW.md`.

## R-001 — AWS account and administrative access

**Problem**
`infra/terraform/modules/` declares the full AWS stack (eight modules, 90 resources) and it has
never been applied: there is no AWS account, administrative principal or bootstrap identity.

**Required owner**
AWS account owner / cloud finance approver.

**Required action**
Provision or nominate the account(s) for `dev` and `prod`, confirm the region (`var.region`; a
fixed `us-east-1` aliased provider serves the CloudFront-scoped WAF regardless), and grant an
engineer a principal able to create IAM, OIDC, S3, DynamoDB, VPC, ECS, RDS, CloudFront, WAFv2,
KMS, Secrets Manager and CloudWatch resources.

**Impact if unresolved**
No workflow that touches AWS (`000`, `100`, `210`, `220`, `330`, `350`, `360`) can run;
only `230` and `300` work.

---

## R-002 — Terraform S3 state backend created out of band

**Problem**
Every root uses an empty `backend "s3" {}`; the bucket and lock table must exist before the first
`terraform init` — Terraform cannot create the backend it is about to use. `000-bootstrap-backend`
will create them once R-001 and R-003 exist; until then they are created by hand.

**Required owner**
AWS account owner (depends on R-001).

**Required action**
Create a versioned, SSE-KMS bucket and a DynamoDB table with a `LockID` (S) partition key, then
record `TFSTATE_BUCKET`, `TFSTATE_LOCK_TABLE`, `AWS_REGION` and `AWS_REGION_SHORT` as repository
variables (state keys are `<env>/platform.tfstate` and `<env>/workload.tfstate`).
`scripts/Initialize-CnaAwsGitHubSecrets.ps1` does all of this idempotently under the account
owner's `aws` and `gh` sessions (`TODO.md` → T-112); it still needs the account from R-001.

**Impact if unresolved**
No Terraform command past `validate` can run.

---

## R-003 — GitHub OIDC deploy role wired into CI

**Problem**
The identity module provisions the GitHub OIDC provider and a deploy role and exports
`github_deploy_role_arn`; nothing consumes it yet, and the role cannot exist before R-001.

**Required owner**
Repository admin together with the AWS account owner.

**Required action**
Apply (or import) the identity module's OIDC provider and role with this repository as the trusted
subject, then store the role ARN as the `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` secret. Long-lived access keys are
not an interim option — the platform is OIDC-only.
`scripts/Initialize-CnaAwsGitHubSecrets.ps1` creates the provider and the role with the module's
exact trust policy, stores the secret, and prints the `terraform import` commands that hand both to
Terraform before the first apply (`TODO.md` → T-112).

**Impact if unresolved**
No workflow can authenticate to AWS.

---

## R-004 — ACM certificates and custom-domain decision

**Problem**
`alb_certificate_arn` and `acm_certificate_arn` are inputs (default `null`) because minting an
unvalidated certificate hangs on DNS validation. Someone has to decide the customer-facing domain
and who owns its DNS.

**Required owner**
DNS / domain owner.

**Required action**
Choose the domain, issue the two certificates (the CloudFront one in `us-east-1`) and record the
ARNs as repository variables; or accept the default CloudFront domain for `dev`.

**Impact if unresolved**
HTTPS on the ALB is skipped and CloudFront serves its default certificate.

---

## R-005 — Amazon Bedrock model access opt-in

**Problem**
`ai_mode: saas` invokes Bedrock through the task role and the inference profile Terraform creates,
but foundation-model access must be enabled manually in the Bedrock console per account and
region before any invocation succeeds. The model id in `infra/terraform/modules/ai/variables.tf`
is also several generations old and must be verified before the first apply.

**Required owner**
AWS account owner.

**Required action**
Enable access for the chosen Anthropic model in the deployment region and update `model_ids` to a
current id. Alternatively deploy with `ai_mode: byo-api`, which needs no Bedrock access at all.

**Impact if unresolved**
`saas` deploys succeed but every AI call fails with an access error.

---

## R-006 — Security review before the first `byo-api` deploy

**Problem**
`ai_mode: byo-api` stores admin-entered Anthropic/OpenAI API keys AES-256-GCM encrypted in the
application database, and the ECS tasks reach `api.anthropic.com` / `api.openai.com` through the
NAT gateway — there is no FQDN egress filter in the AWS platform today. The implementation lives in
the core repository and is complete and tested; CBTS engineering standards require a human
security review before it carries customer traffic.

**Required owner**
Security.

**Required action**
Complete the core repository's `REVIEW.md` → R-011, decide whether the AWS appliance needs an
outbound FQDN control (AWS Network Firewall or a proxy) before its first `byo-api` deploy, and
record the outcome here.

**Impact if unresolved**
`byo-api` cannot be offered to a customer from this appliance.

---

## R-007 — Required reviewers on the `hub` environment

**Problem**
`210-deploy`'s prod `apply` job runs under the `hub` GitHub environment, whose required
reviewers are the human approval gate for production changes. A freshly created repository has no
environments and therefore no gate.

**Required owner**
Repository admin.

**Required action**
Create the `dev`, `prod` and `hub` environments; give `hub` the same required reviewers the core
repository's `hub` environment has; trust subject `environment:hub` of this repository in the OIDC
deploy role (R-003).

**Impact if unresolved**
Prod deploys either fail OIDC or run without human approval.

---

## R-008 — Runtime secrets have no defaults and must be supplied

> Transferred 2026-09-15 from the core repository's `REVIEW.md` → R-006 (core T-507).

**Problem**
Five runtime inputs are declared `sensitive` with **no defaults** and are intentionally absent
from the repository.

**Why it blocks progress**
`terraform apply` on the workload root fails immediately without them. They cannot be committed,
generated by CI, or defaulted safely.

**Required owner**
Security / secret owner (whoever holds the Entra app registration and the Docker Hub
organization).

**Required action**
Supply at apply time, or seed into the chosen secret store:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `db_admin_password` | RDS PostgreSQL master password |
| `nextauth_secret` | NextAuth / Auth.js session secret |
| `entra_client_secret` | Entra ID app-registration client secret |
| `credential_encryption_key` | Application credential-encryption key |
| `dockerhub_username` / `dockerhub_token` | Private image pulls (optional — the module counts off when blank) |

**Impact if unresolved**
No workload apply is possible. Partial supply is worse than none: the database and runtime
modules would apply inconsistently and leave a half-provisioned environment.

**References**
- `infra/terraform/modules/runtime/variables.tf`,
  `infra/terraform/modules/database/variables.tf`
- `.env.example` (the equivalent Azure secret inventory)

**Recommended next step**
Decide where these live for AWS — Secrets Manager seeded out of band, or GitHub environment
secrets passed as `TF_VAR_*`. The Azure side uses Key Vault; the AWS `runtime` module already
provisions Secrets Manager entries, so seeding is the closer mirror.

## R-009 — Repoint `CORE_REPO` at the new core repository

**Problem**
The core moved from `Work-Cloud_Network_Assessment` to `Work-Cloud_Network_Core` (core `TODO.md`
T-509). `230-image-update` reads the build manifest from the repository named by the `CORE_REPO`
variable through the GitHub App; while the variable still names the original repository, this
appliance keeps polling a manifest that will never change again, and the dispatch from the new
core's `200-build-images` reaches this repository only if the App is installed on the new core.

**Why it needs an owner**
Repository variables and GitHub App installations are settings only the repository admin can write.

**Required owner**
Repository admin.

**Required action**
1. Wait until the core's `REVIEW.md` R-013 steps 1 – 4 are done (secrets and variables, App
   installation, and the first `200` run on `Work-Cloud_Network_Core`) — but no later than the
   deletion of the original repository (core `REVIEW.md` → R-014): once it is gone, the old
   `CORE_REPO` value fails with a 404 on every `230` run.
2. *Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables*: set `CORE_REPO` to `Work-Cloud_Network_Core`.
3. Run `230 · Image Update` once from *Run workflow* (`force: false`) and confirm the *Fetch the
   manifest* step reads from the new repository.
4. Do the same in the sibling appliance.

**Impact if unresolved**
No new image set ever reaches this appliance: `dev` stops auto-updating and no `update-available`
issue is opened for `prod`. After the original repository is deleted, every `230` run fails outright.

**References**
- `.github/workflows/230-image-update.yml` (`vars.CORE_REPO`)
- `README.md` → *Configuration*
- Core `REVIEW.md` R-013 / `TODO.md` T-509

## R-010 — Rotate secrets that reached uploaded Terraform plan artifacts

**Problem**
Until 2026-09-23 `210-deploy` uploaded the workload `tfplan-*` file as a run artifact. A saved
Terraform plan stores every variable value in plaintext — `sensitive = true` only redacts CLI
output — so the artifact carried `CNA_POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `CNA_ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET`,
`CNA_NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `CNA_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` for anyone with read access to the
repository, for the default 90-day retention. The upload is removed; the artifacts of past runs
are not.

**Required owner**
Security / secret owner.

**Required action**
Delete every `tfplan-*` artifact under **Actions → run → Artifacts** for past `210` runs. No
live AWS environment exists yet, so nothing needs rotating today; if one is deployed before the
artifacts are gone, rotate the four secrets (rotating `CNA_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` makes every
stored cloud credential and BYO AI key undecryptable — see the core's `TODO.md` → T-707).

**Impact if unresolved**
Repository readers can recover runtime secret values from old artifacts.

## R-011 — The deploy role is account-admin from any branch

**Problem**
`infra/terraform/modules/identity/main.tf` grants the GitHub deploy role `iam:*`, `kms:*`,
`s3:*`, `ec2:*`, `secretsmanager:*` (and more) on `Resource = "*"`, and the OIDC trust accepts
`repo:<owner>/<repo>:*` — every branch and pull request of this repository can assume it.

**Required owner**
AWS account owner (the policy can only be iterated down against live applies — R-001).

**Required action**
Scope the trust to `ref:refs/heads/main` plus the `dev` and `hub` environments, and narrow the
policy to the resource prefixes this appliance creates during the first live applies.

**Impact if unresolved**
Any branch push is account administrator.

## R-012 — Object storage for the AWS appliance

**Problem**
The core's web tier (`apps/cna-web/lib/blob.ts`) and `POST /publish` are Azure-Blob-only; the
AWS Terraform injects `CNA_STORAGE_BUCKET`, which nothing reads. Document upload, deliverable
blobs and the client portal cannot work on AWS until the core gains an S3 path (an S3 deployer
exists only in the CLI package).

**Required owner**
Product owner.

**Required action**
Decide whether AWS 1.0 ships findings/dashboards-only (documented limitation) or waits for the
core's S3 path (core `TODO.md` → T-709).

**Impact if unresolved**
Advertised features fail on AWS.

## R-013 — The ALB has no HTTPS listener until R-004 is decided

**Problem**
CloudFront's origin protocol is `https-only`, but the ALB's HTTPS listener has `count = 0` until
`acm_certificate_arn` is supplied, and the `:80` listener redirects to a listener that does not
exist. Every request returns 502 until R-004 (certificate and domain) is decided.

**Required owner**
DNS / domain owner (R-004).

**Required action**
Resolve R-004; `100-validate-prereqs` should fail fast while the certificate variable is empty.

**Impact if unresolved**
The AWS appliance cannot serve a single request.
